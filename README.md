# Interview Training ðŸ§©

Welcome! ðŸ¤— This repository is intended for my preparation for job interviews.

My main goal here is to practice implementing algorithms and data structures. To achieve this, I am following the procedure below: 

1. Start with an array problem that has been solved by many people.
    - [Code Wars](https://docs.codewars.com/) is an easy leetcode ðŸ˜‰
2. You need to learn the fundamental problem-solving patterns.
3. If you take more than 30 minutes (in flow) and can't solve it, look for the solution.
4. Focus on medium-level problems.
